Plants vs Zombies Remake in Java (LibGDX)
This repository contains a Plants vs Zombies remake developed using Java and the LibGDX framework. The project focuses on implementing key features of the original game while leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a modular and maintainable codebase.

Features
Game Mechanics: Implements core gameplay, including plant placement, zombie movement, resource management, and wave-based combat.
OOP Structure: The code is designed with OOP principles, featuring encapsulated game objects like Plant, Zombie, Projectile, and Lawn classes. These components interact through well-defined interfaces and inheritance hierarchies.
LibGDX Framework: Utilizes the LibGDX game development framework for rendering, asset management, input handling, and game loop management, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and efficient performance.
State Management: Implements a state machine for controlling the game's different phases such as Menu, Gameplay, and Game Over.
Customizable Entities: Plants and zombies are implemented with different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses, allowing for easy extension and modification of new entities.
Collision Detection & Animations: Smooth animation transitions and real-time collision detection between zombies and plants.
How to Run
Clone the repository.
Import the project into your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Run the DesktopLauncher.java class to start the game.
Dependencies
LibGDX: Ensure that the LibGDX dependencies are properly set up in your build system (Gradle or Maven).
